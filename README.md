## Objective: 
      Automate the provisioning of Azure Cosmos DB resources to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.

## Project Overview:


## Tools Used: 

       Terraform, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Resource Manager.

## Key Features: 
       
       Implemented serverless capabilities, configured partition keys for optimal performance, and ensured high availability with multi-region deployments.

## Highlights:

      Utilized Terraform to define infrastructure as code, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.

      Configured Azure Cosmos DB with a focus on serverless architecture, allowing automatic scaling and reduced operational overhead.

      Employed a partition key strategy to optimize data distribution and performance.

## Results:

      Achieved a significant reduction in deployment time and manual errors.
      Enhanced scalability and performance of the database by leveraging Azure's serverless model.
      Enabled seamless integration with existing applications and services.

## Challenges and Learnings:

       Navigating the nuances of serverless configurations in Terraform was a key challenge, but it led to a deeper understanding of both tools.
       Learned the importance of thorough testing and validation in infrastructure deployments to ensure reliability and performance.
